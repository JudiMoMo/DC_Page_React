# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Description
*I DO NOT OWN DC COMICS OR ANY IMAGE USED IN THIS PROJECT. I ONLY USED THEM FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.*
This project is a simple React application that uses the DC Comics API to fetch and display information about DC
Comics characters. The application is built using React, Vite, and CSS.
The application has the following features:
- A search bar that allows users to search for DC Comics characters by name
- A list of characters that match the search query
- A detail page for each character that displays their information
- A navigation bar that allows users to navigate between the search page and the detail page
- A CSS file that styles the application
